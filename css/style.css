/*This above was from google.com/fonts (elsie swash caps and then clicker script).  This is the import method.  If you do that, it goes at the very top of the style sheet and does not need <style> tags. If you input the url above in a broswer, you can see google is just linking this to a font on their server and using font-family*/

/* CSS Syntax:

selector {
  property: value;
  property: value; -- ALWAYS END WITH SEMI-COLEN SO BROWSER DOESN'T GET CONFUSED AND THINK MORE VALUES ARE COMING
}

a type selector is simply something like: */

p {
  font-size: 1em; /* 16px */;
  line-height: 1.5em;
}
  /*-- default for most browsers is this size, 16px;
  you might also see pt for points (which are not the
  same across broswers) OR 100% or 1em. Pixels will be the same across broswers. % and ems will be relative amounts.  Em is the width of an m.  The is 16px. In responsive design, there is value in using ems, but we'll discuss later.  To calculate ems from pixels -- take amount of pixels you'd like to use and divide it by the default (16px).  So 16px font size is equal to 1 em,] */


figcaption {
  /* font-weight: normal;
  font-size: 0.75em;
  line-height: 1.5em;
  font-family: Georgia,"New Times Roman", serif; */
  /* need quotes around NTR because there is a space bw the words. Remember, we are putting multiple fonts to serve as backups in case the first ones don't work.*/
  /* using ems here helps us keep everything relative to the font for <p> above */
